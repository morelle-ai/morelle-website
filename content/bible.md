# MORELLE — CANONICAL STORY (INTERNAL)

## Positioning (One-liner)

Ultra fast charging energy storage systems for next-generation robotics and mobility.

## Core Problem

Untethered robotics and micromobility systems suffer from excessive downtime due to slow charging.
Battery swapping and overprovisioning increase cost, complexity, and operational friction.

## Morelle’s Solution

Morelle provides ultra fast charging battery systems that enable plug-in charging in minutes rather than hours, allowing near-continuous operation without battery swaps.

## Primary Value Proposition

Charging should take minutes, not hours.

## Customer Impact

Morelle customers report up to 99% uptime in robotics fleets, eliminating the need to oversize fleets or maintain spare batteries.

“Our customers were questioning whether robotics was worth the investment when half their fleet was always charging...”
— VP Engineering, Stealth Humanoid Company

## Economic Impact

For a fleet of 100 robots operating 24/7 over 5 years:

- Morelle fast charging shows >3x cost savings compared to battery swap solutions.

## Platform Flexibility

- Custom battery packs
- Custom BMS
- High-power chargers
- Optimized as a system
- Suitable for robotics and micromobility

Validated to exceed 1,000 fast-charge cycles at 5C in internal testing.

## Technology Overview (High Level)

- Silicon-based anode chemistry
- Charger-led control and diagnostics
- Real-time adjustment of charging protocols
- Focus on durability under repeated fast charging

## Charging Levels (Micromobility)

- M1: 100–300W (standard)
- M2: 1000–1200W (Morelle supported)
- M3: >1500W (Morelle proprietary chargers)

## Machine Learning (Guarded)

- Charger runs diagnostics
- Battery health monitored remotely
- Charging behavior adjusted per-use profile
- Goal: improve lifetime fast-charge durability

Avoid claims of “AI optimization” — use “data-driven” and “adaptive”.

## Design Direction (Canonical)

- Square geometry, not rounded
- Technical, modern, startup feel
- Colors:
  - Navy: #0f203b
  - Yellow: #f8be13
- Logo and BG acceptable in monochrome silhouette
- Avoid soft, playful, consumer-app aesthetics
